# General Notes
> You could consider a website as a subset of the functionality of a fully-fledged web  application, but by identifying it as purely a website, it becomes easier to use a set of more constrained tools that will often give you a better result, as well as let you reach that result in less time. Web app toolkits and frameworks may appear powerful, but often break **an important fundamental of the Web - that the Web is made up of a series of linked pages.** If content on your site needs to be linked to directly from a URL, either through sharing the URL on social media, or from a search engine, then considering it a website, and avoiding web app toolkits will allow you to benefit from many fundamental features of the Web (such as shareable URLs, as well as caching and archiving)
***
> Developers who are just starting out often believe that their job is to build what they’re told to build by their managers or clients. **The more experienced a developer becomes, the more they realize that building the right thing is more important than building the thing right.** A quick hack that does what the user needs it to do is much better than a beautifully crafted codebase that doesn’t solve the user’s problem, although a working 
but hacked-together system will quickly stifle progress.
