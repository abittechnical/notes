## Philosophy & Discussion

### TL;DR

#### Definitions
- **Components:**
> A generic term to describe a piece of the website UI. It can refer to a single static HTML element, a whole page or (more commonly) something in between. At its bare minimum it will consist of just a piece of markup, however more complex components can also potentially include styles, behaviour, tests, documentation and more.

- **Component Library:**
> A collection of components, organised in a meaningful manner, and often (but not necessarily) providing some way to browse and preview those components and their associated assets."

#### Be clear on what you are building
1. Who you are
- An agency building component libraries for clients
- An in-house development team
- A freelancer

2. The end goal of the component library.

How will the component library you are building be used?:
- A deeply integrated, living part of a website or application's codebase.
- A code and documentation deliverable for implementation by an in-house team.
- A code and documentation deliverable for implementation by a third party development agency.
- A reference document for different teams in the same organisation, to ensure consistency between sites and/or platforms.
- A public facing site, predominantly for external marketing purposes.
- Any combination of the above (or the many other potential uses!).

#### Build for implementation, not for your tool

Don't get in the way of the consuming endpoint. How you package and bundle your component library should not become an added *feature* of its use. If I decide to use rollup, I shouldn't force any end user of the library to add an additional dependcy of rollup. Think of this constraint like "pre-cooked" meals. A user should be able to just "heat and consume"

#### Integration is hard, so figure it out first

This means a better understanding of how React + Electron coexist in 2019


## The Process

1. Use a style guide for consistent branding

> A style guide clearly deomonstrates how all interface elemnets and components are to be visually represented. It's essentially a master refernce for the user interace (UI) -- Marve Design Team

This can be accomplished by using a designer's 'UI kit' document

2. Use Rollup

As Webpack was created for bundling applications it doesn't support building ESM modules.
> We setup our build system using rollup. It allowed us to bundle our code in two formats: [ECMAScript Modules (EMS)](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html?source=post_page---------------------------) and [CommonJS Modules (CJS)](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html?source=post_page---------------------------). We used [babel-plugin-rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-babel?source=post_page---------------------------) for our JavaScript and [rollup-plugin-postcss](https://github.com/egoist/rollup-plugin-postcss?source=post_page---------------------------)
