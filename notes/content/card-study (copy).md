# React Dribble Card Study

If you've spent any time on the Internet, or more precisely, if you've wasted any time on the Internet, then you  have undoubtedly seen one of those "_what you think you look like_" vs. "_what you __actually__ look like_" comparison memes. If however you are uncultured, by which I mean productive and way more responsible than myself I'll give you the punchline. The what you look like versions are laughably off spec as would be expected in a joke.

It is also a common bit of folk lore within our industry that a developer's implementation of a designer's mock-up occasionally provide a natural reflex for such a comical contrast of intent verse execution. With this in mind, I fired up __web storm__ _(cause not everybody uses vscode, I mean of course I do to...stop distracting me)_, mainlined another dosage of that pure Columbian coffee and pointed one of my twenty tabs to Dribble.com. I decided to let my ego mend itself after two hours of viewing designs I had no hope of ever imagining myself.

All jokes aside, I went to Dribble in search of some info card designs from which I would provide a React, via Material-UI implementation; keeping in mind the motivating scenario of a developer receiving design specifications and tasked with reproducing it as was envisioned. As a result, I chose designs if they met one or more of  the following criteria.  

- **Aesthetically pleasing**.
- **Appeared simple to implement**. 
- **Presented potentially interesting React component design considerations**.

- **Appeared difficult and overly designed** 

The first bullet point is self explanatory. While I didn't finish my degree, I've completed all of the lower division computer science topics and my first language and love is C. Yet I switched to the dark side and currently build for the web because I like pretty things. I chose Dribble because it has pretty pictures.

The second criteria is a little more subtle. The key phrase is _appears  to be simple_. I wanted to explore what potential programming constraints or nuances might contribute in turning what appears to be a straight forward conversion to one requiring a more thoughtful solution.

It should be noted, the actual truth of this whole endeavor was for me to further my React experience. And here you were thinking you were reading the latest post from a seasoned React aficionado (if you weren't thinking that, let's just pretend). I felt like the focused, unitary nature of an info card presented the perfect vehicle to practice thinking  more idiomatically concerning the construction of React based UI components. 

Lastly I wanted to find one of those designs you read about in developer centric blog post. You know the ones where an experienced developer bemoans the overly complex design presented to them.
