# JavaScript Portfolio Project Ideas

## Project One: Cloud Storage Service
Cloud services are still rising in popularity and so too are the need for developers who can build platforms on top of the high performing high intensity hardware. A project that focuses on building a back end system that is capable of uploading and downloading files, with some additional extras such as encryption and file compression (although you could consider this a project all in itself).
My advice would be to build a decoupled front end and back end system, unless you are trying to advertise yourself as a full stack developer. As always as with any portfolio project, try and make sure your code is available for review on your Github.
**Skill set: Back End, Node**

## Project Two: Booking System
A simple booking system such as a taxi service (consider an Uber clone), a medical appointment booking service or a hair dressers booking service as some basic examples. This project could be a great way to show your skills with database interactions within Node, and it could be an opportunity to show how you can work within different databases (such as a version connected to a MongoDB and a version connect to a SQL DB).
A key component in making this project shine on your portfolio is to emphasis the extras — session memory, authentication and even a sandbox payment area can all be used to not only show your skills in Node to process these requests, but also your skills with other frameworks such as Vue or Angular.
**Skill set: Front End, Vue, Angular, Node**

## Project Three: E-Commerce Site
Now it’s no secret that e-commerce sites are a dime a dozen these days, especially with the increase in service like Shopify. However there is a certain skillset required to build an e-commerce site from scratch. You must give consideration to presentation, to database minimization, and to following best practices to ensure the flow through the site is as seamless as possible.
Potential challenges you may face when building this project for your portfolio could include actually creating some mock content for your site, so in that instance it could be best to head on over to Ali Express or similar, pick some random products that are related and stick them in, you don’t need to worry about hooking up an API or similar since you’re not actually allowing purchasing!
**Skill set: Front End, Vue, Angular, React**

## Project Four: Streaming Service
This is potentially the most complex of the four project ideas to implement, and it certainly can be, but if planned adequately it is certainly doable. My advice would be to download some royalty free music (such as from Sound Cloud) and then deliver that content from your back end server to your front end.
This project could also be a way to integrate these projects together, with the back end node server potentially being powered in the same way as the cloud hosting service, or at least sharing a same file downloading approach.
**Skill set: Full Stack, Node**
