### Fundamental Computational Problems 

- Find a solution to a matrix equation $A\bf{x} = \bf{b}$  
- Find the vector $\bf{x}$ minimizing the distance between $A\bf{x}$ and $\bf{b}$ 
- Given a vector $\bf{b}$, find the closest vector to $\bf{b}$ whose representation in a given basis is $k$-sparse
- Find the solution to a matrix inequality $A\bf{x} \le \bf{b}$ 
- Given a matrix $M$, find the closest matrix to $M$ whose rank is at most $k$.

### Multiple Representations

- Representing a vector space by generators or by homogeneous linear equations
- Different bases for the same vector space
- Different data structures used to represent a vector or a matrix
