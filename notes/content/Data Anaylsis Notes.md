# Data Anaylsis Notes


> There is absolutely nothing wrong with speaking of the *"range over which points spread"*, because this phrase means exactly what it says: **the range over which points spread, and only that!** Once we start talking about *"standard deviations"*, this clarity is gone. Are we still talking about the *observed* width of the distribution? Or are we talking about one specific *measure* for this width? ( The standard deviation is only one of several that are avialable). Are we already making an implicit *assumption* about the nature of the distribution? (**The standard dveiation is only suitable under certain conditions, which are often not fulfilled in practice.**)

- Simple is better than complex.
- Cheap is better than expensive.
- Explicit is better than opaque.
- Purpose is more important than process.
- Insight is more important than precision.
- Understanding is more important than thechnique.
- Think more, work less.
