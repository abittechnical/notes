# Build & Destroy #000

**2019 April 16**

Going to see how to structure the design of replicating __Codrops libre__ project

Meet Yendamoi, an old in the tooth yet wet behind the ears junior developer who just landed their first under paying developer job after months of abhorrent coffee consumption and compulsive Goggling. As the sole developer at ACME agency, they have just been handed the new mock design for the companies flagship SPA from the intimidatingly talented in house designers. 

**The Design**

*The lawyers at ACME want me to inform you by "intimidatingly talented in house designers." of a fictitious company I actually mean the **intimidatingly talented designers over at Codrops** who are kind enough to open source these amazing mock-ups and prototypes for the likes of the Yendamois of the world..*

If you have an appreciation for the stage of professional development our protagonist is at you might feel sympathetic seeing the task ahead. Before getting to the design itself we should stipulate some other specifiics for the project.

Lets introduce Moi's *(Yendamoi is a long name to keep typing out, and if you also failed third semester French class you'll see it's a cheeky pun)* project manager. Having spent 30 years managing all the products of ACME, Tim Coyote is a grizzled, shall we say, wile e. veteran, and as such demands cutting edge technology.

This means moi is going to use React, a serverless arcitecture....and anything else 'Tim' feels like moi should learn.
