# React Fundamentals

## Motivation: What makes React so special?

- Its **compositional model**
- Its **declarative nature**
- The way **data flows through a Component**
- And that **React is really just Javascript**

## Composition

### What is composition?

> Composition is just combining simple functions together to create complex functions. 

**Key Ideas**
- simple functions
- combined to create another function
