# MERN Stack

## Setup Database

**Options**

| SQL  | NoSQL |
| ---- | ----- |



## Validation

### Joi

- allows you to create *blueprints/schemas* just like one would use `mongoose` for creating NoSQL schema and you can use it with plain javascript objects

### Express-validator

- *express-validator* uses [validator.js](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js) to validate expressjs routes and itâ€™s mainly built for express js applications which makes this library more niche and provides out of box custom validation and sanitization
